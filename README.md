This project explores advanced regression analysis techniques, focusing on the application of cross-validation and non-linear modeling to three key datasets: the Auto, Wage, and Boston Housing datasets. By employing methods like the validation set approach, leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), and k-fold cross-validation, the project demonstrates how to assess and improve model accuracy while avoiding overfitting. The analysis includes fitting polynomial regression models, using step functions, and applying splines to capture complex relationships within the data. Key findings highlight the effectiveness of a second-degree polynomial model in balancing accuracy and complexity, and the importance of selecting appropriate model complexity to ensure robust predictions.
